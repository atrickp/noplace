    <h3><em>archived from secrets of the city's old website</em></h3>
    <p>Here’s a reminder how the Red Eye Theater’s fantastic New Works 4 Weeks series works: Artists get full access to
      the
      theater, technical support, and feedback from their similarly cool artistic cohorts as everyone develops their
      pieces.
      Then the selected artists have four public performances featuring 15-minute excepts that make up an annual
      must-attend
      performance festival.</p>

    <p>Alana Horton and Patrick Marschke kick off this year’s series with fitter perception, an audio-video presentation
      that “explores the anxiety embedded in the interfaces of our everyday lives”, a very exciting combination of new
      music
      and desktop art (yes, desktop art). As New Works starts, we sent some Quick Questions to Horton and Marschke about
      the
      festival, about all our interfaces and anxieties, about our failing senses, and why you should be hyped on the
      show.
    </p>

    <p>Secrets of the City: Your show is about “fallibility and inscrutability of perception”—did you know about the
      whole
      Laurel-Yanni thing ahead of time or is it just something you’ve always wanted to explore?</p>

    <p>Patrick Marschke: Ha! Well actually that perceptual glitch actually ties in fairly explicitly with one of the
      main
      inspirations for the piece: the incredible taxonomy of human irrationalities that is Wikipedia’s List of Cognitive
      Biases, a list of 100+ known cognitive biases, or “tendencies to think in certain ways that can lead to systematic
      deviations from a standard of rationality.” The list encapsulates a ubiquitous communal anxiety around cognitive
      flaws, amplified by this massively crowd-sourced ‘wiki’ medium. I think the viral-ness of the Laurel-Yanni thing
      is a
      perfect example of just that.</p>

    <p>Alana Horton: There’s a obviously huge cultural obsession that arises around illusions like Laurel-Yanni or “The
      Dress.” I think illusions are so popular because they point to something essential about our relationship with
      perception and truth. They pull back a curtain and make us ask: what is reality if not what we see, hear, feel,
      touch,
      and taste? There’s something magical, and frightening, about having that rug of “truth” pulled from under you.
      That
      feeling really lies at the heart of our piece.</p>

    <p>Secrets of the City:One of the exciting elements of the New Works series is that the pieces are supposed to be
      “fresh”, although some of pieces are much newer and fresher than other pieces, so using something like, say, the
      Rotten Tomatoes freshness scale, how fresh is your new work 0-100%? And why?</p>

    <p>PM: I’d say our work is more on the germination side of “fresh.” This workshop process has lead Alana I into VERY
      different territory than we normally create in. I come from the world of sound and music, Alana coming from a more
      dialogue based theater background. fitter perception is neither of those things… or both of those things
      recontextualized in such a way to spawn something completely different. It really speaks to how Red Eye’s workshop
      process really gives artists the chance to take huge risks, and ideally sow and harvest some very dope
      heirloom-esque
      theater tomatoes. </p>

    <p>AH: I guess I’d ask what it means to be “new” or “fresh” in a culture and time when nothing really feels
      original.
      I’ve always been really inspired by collage, and I think this work speaks to that — it’s taking a lot of familiar
      things like a computer desktop, a cursor, pop-ups, screensavers, and mixing and twisting them in unfamiliar ways,
      making you look at the interfaces of our lives from a new, maybe slightly magical perspective. So maybe we’re
      mashing
      up the rotten tomatoes to make 100% fresh ketchup . . . or gazpacho? </p>

    <p>Secrets of the City:We’re always talking about how criminally underrated the space at the Red Eye is outside the
      die
      hard performance community—did you craft your show for the space in any way? Also, if your show is set on a
      computer
      desktop, how cluttered is the desktop going to be, as cluttered as a Baby Boomer’s Microsoft PC?</p>

    <p>AH: We definitely could not have created this piece outside of Red Eye. Over the course of this five-month
      process,
      we were given total access to their space and equipment, and the work very much reflects that. They have some
      really,
      really, really nice projectors and screens, and we just got to tinker with them and use them and figure out what
      worked best for the piece! Which turned out to be a pretty austere desktop, actually. </p>

    <p>PM: Honestly I’m still baffled as to why they let a weirdo music person (me) make a thing in their pristine black
      box
      theater. As a musician I can’t really think of a more captive audience (i.e. trapped in their seats with no bar to
      chit-chat at) than an experimental workshop theater audience. And we certainly did not take that opportunity
      lightly
      in creating this piece! </p>

    <p>Secrets of the City:Help sell the other pieces in the festival! What other pieces from your contemporaries in the
      New
      Works are you excited to see?</p>

    <p>AH: There’s such an incredible range of projects. Anna Johnson has put together a literal blanket fort on stage,
      and
      is exploring self and scale with these complex textural sound and video installations. Billy Noble has made a
      really
      funny and also terrifyingly bleak piece about AI and chat-bots with one of my favorite performers in town, Lauren
      Rae
      Anderson. Arneisha Williams has put together a breathtaking solo dance/sound/spoken piece examining inclusion and
      exclusion and self and community that really shows how big Red Eye is as a space. And Kaya Lovestrand is playing
      around with dance and poetry to create a super rigourous, quirky, abstract piece of duet movement. All the pieces
      are
      weird and experimental and engaging and incredible and you should definitely come and see them. Sold?</p>

    <p>PM: I regularly forget that this evening of works is in no way “curated.” Folks applied with a inkling of an idea
      for
      a project and were given 5 months to make it into something people would buy tickets for. Any of the themes we
      have
      mentioned could really be extrapolated on any of the works. Having just run the tech minutes before writing this I
      can
      truly attest that the other works really frame each other in a way that I could have never imagined. I think this
      speaks to the community and vision that Miriam and Steve have cultivated over their 35 years! That goes for the
      Independent Acts over the next 4 weeks as well!</p>
