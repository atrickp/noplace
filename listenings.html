    <p><strong><a href="https://bensloan.bandcamp.com/album/muted-colors">muted colors
          by Ben Sloan</a></strong> <br>
      this isn't out yet but i have a feeling it is gonna be very good. pal chris brought it to my attention to it,
      which i am very thankful for</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://riantreanor.bandcamp.com/album/saccades">Saccades by Rian Treanor & Ocen
          James</a></strong> <br>
      kinetic, bouncy, and human. makes me excited about collaboration.
    </p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npStOjDhI_4">Only by Morton Feldman</a> (sang by Joan La
        Barbara)</strong><br>My friend Anat showed me this recently. it is beautiful for a lot of reasons, but i am most
      struck by how it feels literally *perfect* for La Barbara's voice, almost as if it had existed within her for
      centuries.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaCe273ScPA">Solo e pensoso by Luca
          Marenzio</a></strong><br>those first few notes are nutso! super fun harmony. I liked this a lot before I read
      the <a href="https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Solo_e_pensoso">lyrics</a> and like it even more now having done
      so.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://ullastraus.bandcamp.com/album/tumbling-towards-a-wall">Tumbling Towards a Wall
          by Ulla</a></strong><br>toivo shared this on the internet somewhere. very subtle but i find myself always
      finding something new in it with each new listenings.</p>

          I get along without you very wellby Ellen Arkbro & Johan Graden</a></strong><br>

    <p><strong><a href="https://health.bandcamp.com/album/axis">
          AXIS by Church Andrews & Matt Davies.</a></strong><br>
      they do some very clever trigger > synthesis/sample stuff on all of their stuff â€“ such a simple idea that hasn't
      been as explored as i'd expect. u know what that means :P. <br>
      <a href="https://health.bandcamp.com/album/neighbours">NEIGHBOURS</a> by them is also very good
