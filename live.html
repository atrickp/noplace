      <p><a href="https://www.slodancecompany.org/">Slo Dance Company</a> presents an evening of dance and live music
        considering the various duets we find ourselves
        existing in--with sound, with space, with time, and with each other. Two dance works on the program will invite
        performers and audience members alike to be curious about what new relationships might be revealed in the act of
        slowing down. </p>

      <p>Slo Dance Company is led by Artistic Director Laura Osterhaus Rosenstone, who works with a rotating group of
        collaborators. The program at the Southern Theater features dance artists Noelle Awadallah, Emilia Bruno,
        Alexandra Eady, Emma Marlar, Leslie O'Neill, Jamie Ryan-Karels, and Sarah Steichen Stiles with music
        collaborator Patrick Marschke.</p>
