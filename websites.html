      <p>A binaural sine wave sharing platform and archive.</p>
      <p>I think that any sound can elicit feelings, memories, and/or novel thoughts. I wanted to test the limits of
        this. <a href="https://tones4u.org">tones4u.org</a> allows users to assemble 4 binaural* sine waves to any
        frequency and then provides a really
        simple way to share these tones with anyone just by sharing a url. If they like their set of tones enough they
        can submit them to the Tones Archive.</p>
      <p class="footnote"><em>* Meaning that they are separated into two distinct channels (left and right), which when
          listened to with
          headphones can create uncanny psychoacoustic effects, sometimes referred to as binaural beats.</em></p>

      <p>My partner Alana thinks our dog Arlo is the cutest. I wanted to know if this was actually the case, so I made a
        website that would quantify his cuteness. What I ended up making is basically tinder for dogs. <a

    <h2>Eternal September (coming soon...)</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Eternal September</em> is a deeply collaborative and extensive
      alternate reality (aka MetaVerse) composed of interlocking music, text,
      and video. Content in <em>Eternal September</em> is linked together by its own
      indigenous Wiki System and will be supported by a decentralized,
      equitable blockchain. There is no defining form of the
      <em>Eternal September</em> - it is an organic and open-ended exercise in
      collective imagination.
