    <p>Six years ago at a new years eve party at Third Space (RIP) I performed a 15-20 minute solo drums and electronics
      set to a crowded gym of mostly people I didn't know. I don't remember anything of what I played or what it sounded
      like. My lack of recollection was certainly due in part to nerves and NYE related mental states, but more
      viscerally for me, the gaps in my memory were reflective of how HARD my brain was working to make the performance
      happen. The electronics component of my setup utilized a midi drum pad which “extended” my drum set into the
      digital sampling realm. The rubber pads are “struck” just like a drum, but the sound that comes out is nothing
      like a drum. By design, I actually had no idea what sound would come out of this new meta-instrument, which
      required that I listen and react at what felt like the speed of sound. The instrument pulled me places I would
      never go on my own and in the process it required me to kind of ‘begin again’ and start from scratch with regards
      to my approach to drums and performance.</p>

    <p>The last time I remember feeling something like this was the first time I took a drum solo in public playing with
      my junior high jazz band. Both of these moments are incredibly significant for my artistic trajectory — they are
      moments in which I felt entirely 'hooked' to this feeling of being on the edge of possibility. It is a feeling I
      would chase from those moments onwards. Upon further reflection, it is not the exhilaration of the 'flow' state
      that people sometimes talk about that ‘hooked’ me. I think I have experienced 'flow' as well, and it normally
      doesn't involve blacking out lol. Nor was my enchantment with this mental state about impressing anyone with any
      type of virtuosity (that first drum solo certainly lacked any of that!). Instead, I think my brain sensed a latent
      potential in attempting to do something right on the cusp of my ability. I sensed a potential for fluency, and
      from that fluency would come new, more complex, and fascinatingly nuanced potentials for expression. </p>

    <p>Despite my verbosity here I think in the past few months I have come to realize that despite my best efforts
      words often fail to capture what I am actually FEELING at any given moment. This is definitely why I love
      music(duh)! Another thing that I am coming to accept about myself is that it isn’t just music, but LIVE music that
      I am drawn to, which my live drum+electronics setup is definitely more suited to. </p>

    <p>Six years later I am not blacking out anymore! But I am still finding new latent spaces for expression with my
      setup as the instrument and I continue to evolve. The most significant development since those early solo
      performances is finding opportunities for collaboration. Luckily, someone that saw some of those early solo
      performances was <a href="https://www.slodancecompany.org/">Laura Osterhaus Rosenstone</a>, who upon first seeing
      my set without really knowing me at all approached me and told me something along the lines of “I want to make a
      work with your music on proscenium size stage” — and crazily enough
      that is literally happening next <a
        href="https://southerntheater.org/shows/slo-dance-company-at-the-southern-theater ">Friday and Saturday (Jan
        6/7) at The Southern Theater</a>! It’ll be an evening
      of dance and music with Laura and seven other incredible movers that I am so honored to perform with! </p>

    <p>I honestly can’t imagine finding a more ideal collaborator for my music making practice. Laura’s Slo
      practice and her resultant choreographic development process is a beautiful mechanism for consistently finding the
      “potential for fluency” and “new, more complex, and fascinatingly nuanced potentials for expression” in a movement
      practice. It is hard to describe with words! So you should just come experience for yourself, either by attending
      one of our performances or participating yourself during our open Slo practice Saturday, January 7th 10-11:15 am
      at The Southern :)</p>

    <p>Let me know if Money is a barrier for attending! </p>

    <p><a href="https://www.slodancecompany.org/">Slo Dance Company</a> presents an evening of dance and live music
      considering the various duets we find ourselves
      existing in--with sound, with space, with time, and with each other. Two dance works on the program will invite
      performers and audience members alike to be curious about what new relationships might be revealed in the act of
      slowing down. </p>

    <p>Slo Dance Company is led by Artistic Director Laura Osterhaus Rosenstone, who works with a rotating group of
      collaborators. The program at the Southern Theater features dance artists Noelle Awadallah, Emilia Bruno,
      Alexandra Eady, Emma Marlar, Leslie O'Neill, Jamie Ryan-Karels, and Sarah Steichen Stiles with music
      collaborator Patrick Marschke.</p>
