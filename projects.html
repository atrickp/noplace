      </p>
      <p>l(a [pronounced ‘wuhn ey'] is a catchall for all of my various ventures as a solo performer, which usually
        entails me, some drums, and some electronics. It began in 2016 as a max/msp patch engineered for the roland
        spd-sx
        sampling pad, which is normally used to integrate electronic drum sounds into an acoustic drum setting (think
        claps and snaps). i found myself frustrated with the limited built-in capabilities of the device and started to
        explore ways that it could be used as the core of a solo acoustic drum and electronics performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I ended up with was an incredibly compelling performance environment oriented around randomized sequential
        microsampling that has single-handedly revolutionized the way that I perform and think about music, challenging
        me
        technically and emotionally, and pushing me past what I thought was possible as a solo performer.

        <p>My practice is heavily influenced by <a href="https://www.deantoniparks.com/">Deantoni Parks</a>' Technoself
          School of Philosophy, which I would summarize as
          the practice of conceiving of and building custom meta-instruments that become their own distinct conceptual
          frameworks for further research. This practice then becomes a lifelong conceptual + technical + research
          oriented
          feedback loop.</p>
        <p>In a way, this approach is not so different from the century-long tradition of the [“Trap Kit,”] the earliest
          iteration of a drum set: building a completely unique and utilitarian “contraption” of any instrument that can
          fit
          in front of you, all to serve the needs of whatever the music and context call for. </p>
        <p>Digital audio, portable computers, and applications like [max/msp] have made the quick prototyping, thorough
          testing, and eventual mastery of completely new instruments more accessible than ever. And I have embraced the
          opportunity. </p>
        <p>The majority of the instruments I have created demand a technical proficiency on some level or another — in
          this
          way the instrument always require growth and keeps me endlessly curious about what *could be* possible.
          Leaving
          a
          little room for “error” makes for a much more compelling live experience. And these “errors” can lead to
          completely new sonic opportunities.</p>

      <p>Created in partnership with Alana Horton and commissioned by Red Eye Theater as part of New Works 4 Weeks
        Festival 2021, <span class="caps">ANOMALOUS_U</span> is a participatory performance experience exploring

        <p>For the festival iteration, participants received texts that included links and instructions which guided
          them
          through the “performance” over the course of 10 days, which unfolded through phone calls, websites, and audio
          experiences.</p>
        <p>As a piece created during a time when it seemed like everything was being mediated through a screen (aka
          ~*Peak
          COVID*~), we very much enjoyed making a work that encouraged and enabled participants to look and explore
          within
          and be as authentically present as possible, requiring as little active screen time as possible through the
          use
          of
          phone calls and embedded web audio, and allowing them to access the material at any time that was convenient
          for
          them.</p>

      <p>Reality isn't shaped like a story — but we can't help but perceive it as one. This constant dissonance was at
        the
        question at the root of fitter perception, a performance that explored the contradictions embedded in the
        liminal
        space between our minds, bodies, and machines. This is a piece about storylessness, a journey without a
        destination, a practice of abstraction, a metaphor of self. Created in partnership with Alana Horton and

      <p>Realtree is a band made up of cello (Michelle Kinney), cornet (Noah Ophoven-Baldwin), clarinet(Carley Olson
        Kokal), electric guitar (Adam Zahller), and laptop (me). We focus on performing songs that use monophonic and
        timer-controlled compositions as temporal structures for improvisations. </p>

        <p>Material for each song originates from previous performances, miscellaneous audio, or simply other songs.
          Noah
          transcribes excerpts and uses them as building blocks for the compositions. Realtree's previous release,
          "Splendor
          Falls on Everything Around" (Public Eyesore Records), has been described as “quite orderly” (The Wire) and
          “totally captivating” (Vital Weekly).</p>
        <p>I developed a suite of stand-alone max-msp patches applications that can be used on their own, or in tandem
          as
          an
          expressive meta-instrument ideal for improvised settings. I'm able to capture live input for processing,
          visceral
          sonic sculpting, and novel synthesis techniques on the fly. I also recorded and mixed Realtree's debut record
          and
          recently released “Shake the Hourglass About.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Founded by Artistic Director and Choreographer, Laura Osterhaus, Slo Dance Company finds its footing in the
        importance of Slowness, a practice of slowing down the speed of our lives in contrast with the fast-pace of
        society, and finding a space for performers to explore their own authentic presence. In collaboration with
        Laura,
        I apply the Slo Practice to my music making process, generating novel collaborative sonic scores for slo dance
        company's live performances.</p>
      <p>The Slo Practice works to reclaim the institutionalized perception of time through hypersensitivity to our own
        embodiment in any given context and expresses itself through movement. Practicing intentional slowness
        encourages
        us to feel our internal pace in contrast to the demands of capitalism. In this way, we can utilize slowness in
        relationships as a countercultural practice that allows time to be an elusive variable, focusing on care in any
        given process of building, creating, or being together.</p>
