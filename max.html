    <p>Since delving into the realm of digital sound production in 2013, I have used the visual programming language
      Max/MSP to build hundreds of custom sound applications. Some are simple utilitarian sonic effects, some one-off
      experiments, but many are complex interactive digital instruments. My key areas of interest have been exploring
      the boundaries of aural perception and building immersive improvisational environments for live performance.</p>

    <h1>1(a // December 2016 to present</h1>
    <p>This project was engineered for the Roland SPD-SX sampling pad, which is normally used to integrate electronic
      drum
      sounds into an acoustic drum setting (think claps and snaps). I found myself frustrated with the limited built-in
      capabilities of the device and started to explore ways that it could be used as the core of a solo acoustic drum
      and
      electronics performance. What I ended up with was an incredibly compelling performance environment oriented around
      randomized sequential microsampling that has single-handedly revolutionized the way that I perform and think about
      music, pushing me past what I thought was ever possible as a solo performer — and there is still more to discover!

    <h1>Alone-a // July 2018 to present</h1>
    <p>Commissioned and developed in partnership with Alana Horton, Alone-a is a solo exploratory sonic project that
      explores the limits of memory and moment through vast tapestries of digital delays, small found objects and voice,
      and densely rich signal processing. Every audible sound generated by this application is derived solely from the
      performers’ live input to surprising, chaotic, and ecstatic ends.</p>

    <h1>Realtree Suite // May 2016 to present</h1>
    <p>Realtree is an instrumental improvising ensemble that is heavily influenced by lowercase music, field recordings,
      minimalism, and numerology consisting of cornet, cello, clarinet, guitar, electronics. For this project, I
      developed
      a suite of stand-alone applications that can be used on their own, or in tandem as an expressive meta-instrument
      ideal for improvised settings. I’m able to capture live input for processing, sculpt samples like clay, and
      synthesize otherworldly tones on the fly.</p>

    <h1>fitter perception // premiered May 24, 2018</h1>
    <p>Created in collaboration with Alana Horton as part of Red Eye Theater’s Works in Progress program in the Spring
      of
      2018, fitter perception was an experiential theater piece that took place entirely on the desktop of a computer. I
      built an application that allowed the performer of the piece (Horton) to control all of the tightly synchronous
      sound design via desktop controls, turning the laptop into not only the stage for the performance but also the
      sound/tech booth. Auditory illusions and sonic alienation were a key component of the piece, which would not have
      been possible without the flexibility of Max/MSP. </p>

    <h1>Technoself // November 2018 to present</h1>
    <p>Inspired by Deantoni Park’s approach to performative precision microsampling in combination with world-class
      drumming, I set out to recreate Park’s instrument in Max/MSP while expanding its expressive potential through
      novel
      approaches to randomizing parameters and effects.</p>

    <h1><span class="caps">[WHAT”S THE POINT!]</span> // yet to be utilized :(</h1>
    <p>This work was being developed as part of Red Eye Theater’s 2020 Isolated Acts program in
      collaboration with Alana Horton before being cancelled due to covid. The application allows us to “perform” a
      quadraphonic sound system,
      utilizing a huge palette of custom signal processing and inventive sound design with the goal of framing the
      literal
      experience of hearing/seeing as worthy an object of artistic focus as any. Tightly synchronous lighting and
      projection are areas of interest that we plan on integrating into the working application at some point.</p>
